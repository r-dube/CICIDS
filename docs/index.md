The CICIDS2017 dataset contains information on network traffic flows. The 
traffic flows are tagged as benign or one of several attacks. The CICIDS2017 
Analysis Project attempts to understand the characteristics of various techniques 
that separate the benign traffic flows from attack traffic flows.
