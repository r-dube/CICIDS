**Title:** (Mis)use of the CICIDS 2017 Dataset in Information Security Research

**Abstract:** The summarized traffic flow version of the CICIDS 2017 dataset created at the University of New Brunswick is popular in the information security data science research community. Typically, researchers use the summarized data to develop supervised machine learning models and test the classification performance of these models. In this paper, we explore the adequacy of the summarized data for high-performance classification. We show that machine learning models developed over summarized data are unlikely to have practical import. Finally, we postulate that researchers may have a higher probability of creating a useful system if they use raw (non-summarized) data.
